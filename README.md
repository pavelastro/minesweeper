# minesweeper

This is a Python implementation of 2-D Minesweeper!
```
python3 minesweeper.py
```
this script will automatically initialize it to a 10x10 board, with 10 bombs if not initialized

inputs must be that the number of bombs is less than the total number of spaces (n^2).

In order to place  mark at a certain location, you type in the index of the row, then the column, separated by a comma (whitespace optional)

You can continue digging until either you hit a bomb (which is game over) or you've successfully dug up all n-b non-bomb locations (which is victory)!

This repo contains two files:
- minesweeper.py: implementation of minesweeper
